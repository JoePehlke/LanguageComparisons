Passing by value is where where a copy of the parameters of the function call is made, and the copy is modified in the called function. 
The changes made to parameters in pass by reference are local to the called function. 

Passing by reference(AKA passing by address) is when the actual parameter is passed and there is no extra time/memory taken to copy
